### Hi!

My name is Kasia Zawistowska,

- I am an Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh. ðŸŽ“
- I currently work at Justfone, a local company in my hometown. ðŸ’¼

My job at Justfone is to create apps using Dart and the Flutter framework, populate them using the Firebase database and occasionally create Google Cload Functions with Python. I am constantly learning new tools and features.

I have graduated Highschool with 5 A's for my SQA Higher subjects and 2 A's for my SQA Advanced Highers (Mathematics and Computer Science).
