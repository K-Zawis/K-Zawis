My name is Kasia Zawistowska,

I am an Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh. I currently work at Justfone. I have worked there for over a year and my job there is to create apps using Dart and the Flutter framework and then populate them using the Firebase database. I also have some basic experience creating Google Cload Functions with Python.

I have graduated Highschool with 5 As for my Higher subjects and predicted 3 As for my Advanced Highers.
